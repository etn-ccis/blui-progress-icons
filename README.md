This is a library of icons with dynamic fill capabilities that can be used to show progress (similar to a traditional progress spinner or bar). These can be used to show health, battery life, etc.

## Install and Use

The progress icon components can be imported and used like you would use any other component. You can manually set the desired color for the icon, otherwise it will inherit the text color of its parent container.

For detailed usage, please follow the guidance for each framework:

- [Angular](https://github.com/etn-ccis/blui-progress-icons/blob/master/angular/README.md)
- [React](https://github.com/etn-ccis/blui-progress-icons/blob/master/react/README.md)
- [React Native](https://github.com/etn-ccis/blui-progress-icons/blob/master/react-native/README.md)
